## QYT App

This is a native app wrapping QYT functionality.

It is built using [Fyne](https://fyne.io).
It has been tested and works on GOOS=darwin (macOS) and GOARCH=amd64,arm64 (intel and Apple Silicon).
You can build from source and it might work on linux or windows.

It uses the same flags, environment variables, and arguments as the standalone qyt binary.
